# ChemESolver

Calculation package for Chemical Engineering problems

## Distillation

McCabe-Thiele Analysis for non-ideal liquid mixtures. Currently supports the
modified Raoult's Law model for vapor-liquid equilibrium. Support for ideal
Raoult's Law in the pipeline. 

### Features:

#### Distillation

1. Determination of minimum reflux ratio under optionally specified feed conditions
2. Calculation of operating lines given flow rates or ratios and desired product purities
3. Calculation of pseudoequilibrium curve under specified operating conditions and Murphree efficiency
4. Determination of stage counts under specified conditions
5. Calculation of tray compositions for McCabe-Thiele diagram plotting

#### Thermodynamics

1. Antoine Model for calculation of vapor pressures/boiling points
2. Binary Wilson Model for calculation of liquid phase activity coefficients
3.
